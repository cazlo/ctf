/**
 * Abstract interface class that must be implemented by an agent.  
 * Forces agents to implement a function
 * that maps environment state to an action.<BR>
 * <BR>
 * Your agent class MUST subclass the <code>Agent</code>.  See
 * {@link ctf.agent.ChenSimpleAgent} for an example of how to do this.<BR>
 * <BR>
 * The icon that is drawn to represent an agent is created in
 * <code>drawIcon</code>.  If you want to create a custom icon for your agent,
 * override the <code>drawIcon</code> method.  Since making a custom icon
 * isn't necessary, we don't provide an example agent that does this.<BR>
 * <BR>
 * Feel free to implement other internal methods in your <code>Agent</code> 
 * subclass that aren't defined in this interface.  You're also free to define
 * any needed inner classes, as well as any internal data structures.  
 * One restriction
 * is that all of your code must be in a single java file called
 * "NetIDAgent.java", where NetID is the net-id of one of the human members
 * of your team.  Thus, if you want to use more than one class (for example,
 * to implement data structures), you must make inner classes.  This is
 * due to the Java restriction that each non-inner class must be defined in
 * its own .java file.<BR>
 * <BR>
 * Note:<BR>
 * All agents must also implement a parameterless constructor!  (An easy way
 * to meet this requirement is to write no constructor at all.)
