Development Platform:    Developed in Pycharm on Linux using python 2.7.6			 

Running the program:     Usage: python main.py <variable file> <constraint file> <consistency enforcing>
                              where: the variable file consists of variables and their domains
				     the constraint file lists constraints using =, !, >, or < operators
				     the consistency enforcing is either 'none' (for backtracking)
       				     	 or 'fc' for forward checking
