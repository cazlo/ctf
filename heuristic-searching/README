Development Platform:    Developed in Pycharm on Linux using python 2.7.6

Problems encountered:    I couldn't get the cost flag to work right because I was not adding the g to the parent's g. After I did that, everything fell into place pretty easily. Also, this program runs kind of slow for the states of size 13, so I tried to do some optimizations, like storing g and h instead of recalculating it and nto sorting after each add to the DS.  Unfortunately, it still takes about 6 minutes to do A-star for 13 sized initial states, and I can't spot any glaring performance issues.  If you see some please tell me!
			 

Running the program:     python main.py <BFS|DFS|UCS|GS|A-star> <inputfile> [-cost]
                              note that cost is optional and will only affect UCS and A-star
